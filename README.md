# Bank tech test

A tech test from Makers coding bootcamp, originally completed in JavaScript [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/bank_tech_test). I am completing it again as part of my TypeScript practice.

I was also able to optimise and clean the code up further vs my initial attempt. 

My solution:
- solves all user stories
- all classes fully mocked with dependancy injection
- 100% test coverage
- linted with ESlint
